# Introduction

Draqula is a GraphQL client for React apps that don't need everything.
It provides only the essential React hooks for building apps - queries ([`useQuery`](/docs/queries)) and mutations ([`useMutation`](/docs/mutations)), which is enough for the majority of web apps out there.
It doesn't offer extensive cache mechanisms, local state management, higher-order or render-prop components.
By skipping all of that, Draqula can maintain a small and simple codebase and focus on executing the basics well.

If you need any of these, you can use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) instead.

Here's how Draqula looks and works:

```jsx
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	{
		todos {
			id
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Todos = () => {
	const [data, loading, error] = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	return (
		<>
			{loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
			{error && <span>Oops, something went wrong!</span>}
			{data && (
				<ul>
					{data.todos.map(todo => (
						<li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			)}
		</>
	);
};
```

## Features

- Simple API and codebase
- Basic cache implementation with aggressive invalidation and refetching
- Automatic retries of network/timeout errors and GraphQL queries
- Keeps data in multiple tabs in sync
- Straightforward way to hook into requests without a need for middleware

## What is not supported?

Here are the features that are planned to be implemented soon:

- Server-side rendering
- Polling of queries
- Lazy queries (trigger a query on demand)
- Pause queries if client is offline

And here are the things that will not be implemented:

- Higher-order components
- Render-prop components
- Subscriptions (at least not in the foreseeable future)
- Caching implementation similar to the one in Apollo

## Can I use Draqula in production?

No, not yet. I would appreciate if you tested Draqula in your personal projects or experiments though!
I want to give Draqula time to stabilize its API and fix any bugs that could come up to ensure that when 1.0 version is out, it's safe for production apps.
