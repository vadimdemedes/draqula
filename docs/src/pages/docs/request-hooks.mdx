# Request hooks

Request hooks are [hooks provided by `ky`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky#hooks).
These hooks let you intercept request and response stage of the query or mutation and modify basically everything.

## beforeRequest

This hook allows you to modify a request before it's sent to the server.
It's commonly useful for adding an authorization token for your server or attaching a CSRF token.

```js
import {Draqula} from 'draqula';

const authToken = 'super secret token';

const client = new Draqula('https://graph.ql', {
	hooks: {
		beforeRequest: [
			request => {
				request.headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`);
			}
		]
	}
});
```

## afterResponse

This hook lets you check or modify a response before Draqula starts processing it.
You could use `afterResponse` hooks to log requests, report errors to Sentry (or other error tracking service) or reauthenticate a user with a fresh access token.

```js
import {Draqula} from 'draqula';

const client = new Draqula('https://graph.ql', {
	hooks: {
		afterResponse: [
			response => {
				if (response.status === 500) {
					alert('Server is down, check back later');
				}
			}
		]
	}
});
```
