# Mutations

Unlike queries, mutations in GraphQL are used to create, update or delete data.
For this purpose, Draqula offers a `useMutation` hook.
Just like queries, remember to define your GraphQL queries **outside** your components to prevent infinite unnecessary rerenders.

## Basic mutations

Assuming the server implements a `ping` mutation, that simply returns `"pong"` string, here's an example of the most basic mutation:

```jsx
const PING_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation {
		ping
	}
`;

const PingPong = () => {
	const {mutate} = useMutation(PING_MUTATION);

	const onPing = async () => {
		const data = await mutate();
		// {
		//   ping: 'pong'
		// }
	};

	return <button onClick={onPing}>Ping</button>;
};
```

Mutations without variables are not that useful, so let's add some variables to closer match reality.

## Variables

Similar to `useQuery`, `useMutation` also accepts variables.
The only difference is that you don't pass them to `useMutation` itself, but to the `mutate` function that it returns.

```jsx
const CREATE_TODO_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation CreateTodo($title: String!) {
		createTodo(title: $title) {
			id
			title
		}
	}
`;

const CreateTodo = () => {
	const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
	const {mutate} = useMutation(CREATE_TODO_MUTATION);

	const onCreateTodo = async event => {
		// Prevent the form from refreshing the page
		event.preventDefault();

		try {
			await mutate({title});

			// Todo was successfully created
		} catch (error) {
			// Uh oh, something went wrong
		}
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={onCreateTodo}>
			<input type="text" value={title} onChange={event => setTitle(event.target.value)} />
			<br />
			<button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
		</form>
	);
};
```

## Caching

When a mutation succeeds, Draqula scans the GraphQL types returned from that mutation and refetches all queries that use any of these types.
For example, let's say we have the following GraphQL schema on our server:

```gql
type Query {
	posts: [Post!]!
	pages: [Page!]!
}

type Mutation {
	createPost(title: String!): Post!
}

type Post {
	title: String!
}

type Page {
	title: String!
}
```

Imagine we also have the following code for our page:

```jsx
const POSTS_QUERY = gql`
	query {
		posts {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const PAGES_QUERY = gql`
	query {
		pages {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const CREATE_POST_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation CreatePost($title: String!) {
		createPost(title: $title) {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION);

	return (
		<>
			{/* ... */}
			<button onClick={() => createPost({title: 'Stranger Things'})}>Create Post</button>
		</>
	);
};
```

If a user clicks the "Create Post" button, the `createPost` mutation will be executed, which returns only the `Post` type.
That tells Draqula to find all queries that contain the `Post` type and refetches them.
In this case, `POSTS_QUERY` is the only one that uses this type, so it will be refetched, while `PAGES_QUERY` will remain in the same state.

## Refetch queries

However, sometimes a server uses the same data source but returns it under various types.
In that case, Draqula has no way to know that some query uses the same data under the hood and we need to help it find those queries to refetch.
This is where the `refetchQueries` option comes in.
It's a list of queries to refetch in addition to the ones Draqula finds by itself.

So if in theory, `PAGES_QUERY` needed to be refetched after the `createPost` mutation, this is how it would work:

```js
const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION, {
		refetchQueries: [PAGES_QUERY]
	});

	// ...
};
```

It's important to mention that by default `createPost` doesn't wait for queries to finish refetching.
If this behavior is important for you, you can opt-in for that via the `waitForRefetchQueries` option:

```js
const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION, {
		waitForRefetchQueries: true,
		refetchQueries: [PAGES_QUERY]
	});

	const onCreatePost = async () => {
		try {
			await createPost({title: 'Stranger Things'});

			// Both POSTS_QUERY and PAGES_QUERY are refetched at this point
		} catch (error) {
			// ...
		}
	};

	// ...
};
```

## API

### useMutation(query, options?)

This hook returns a [`MutationResult`](/docs/mutations#mutation-result) object.

#### query

Type: `DocumentNode`

Parsed GraphQL query via `gql` function from the [`graphql-tag`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) module.

For example:

```js
const PING_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation {
		ping
	}
`;
```

#### options

Type: `object`

##### options.refetchQueries

Type: `DocumentNode[]`<br/>
Default: `[]`

List of queries to refetch after the mutation succeeds.

##### options.waitForRefetchQueries

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `false`

Determines whether to wait for queries to refetch or complete the mutation immediately.

### MutationResult

The `useMutation` hook returns an object consisting of the following fields.

#### mutate

Type: `Function`

A function that triggers a mutation.
Accepts an optional object of variables to pass to the mutation.
Returns a promise that resolves when the mutation is completed.

```js
const {mutate} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION);

const onCreatePost = async () => {
	await mutate({
		title: 'New Post'
	});
};
```

#### data

Type: `object`<br/>
Default: `null`

Data returned from the query.

#### isLoading

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `false`

Indicates whether the mutation is currently in-flight.

#### error

Type: `NetworkError | GraphQLError | null`<br/>
Default: `null`

The error returned from the mutation request.
