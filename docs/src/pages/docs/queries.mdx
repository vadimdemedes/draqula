# Queries

Queries in Draqula are executed via the `useQuery` React hook, exposed from the `draqula` module:

```jsx
import {useQuery} from 'draqula';
```

All queries **must** be using the `gql` tag function from the [`graphql-tag`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) module and they **must** be defined outside your component.
If you define a query inside your component, it will be reconstructed on every render, which will make Draqula refetch it infinitely.

```jsx
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

// Incorrect
const Todos = () => {
	const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
		{
			todos {
				title
			}
		}
	`;

	const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	// ...
};

// Correct
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	{
		todos {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	// ...
};
```

## Basic queries

Here's how to perform a simple query without any variables or options:

```jsx
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	{
		todos {
			id
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	return (
		<>
			{isLoading && <span>Loading…</span>}
			{error && <span>Error: {error.message}</span>}
			{data && (
				<ul>
					{data.todos.map(todo => (
						<li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			)}
		</>
	);
};
```

`useQuery` returns an object with these essential fields:

- **data** - Query response
- **isLoading** - Boolean that indicates if the query is still loading
- **error** - Network or GraphQL error

We're not going to take a deep dive into error handling yet, but you can jump into the ["Error Handling"](/docs/error-handling) page to learn more about it.
For the sake of simplicity of the following examples, I'm going to skip all JSX code going forward.

## Variables

Variables can be passed to a query via a second argument to `useQuery`, like so:

```jsx
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	query Todos($page: Int!) {
		todos(page: $page) {
			id
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY, {
		page: 1
	});

	// ...
};
```

Whenever query variables are updated, Draqula will fetch the same query with new variables as well as reset `data` to `null` and mark the query as loading (`loading === true`).

```js
const Todos = () => {
	const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
	const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY, {page});

	const onNextPage = () => {
		setPage(page => page + 1);
	};

	return (
		<>
			{/* ... */}

			<button onClick={onNextPage}>Load next page</button>
		</>
	);
};
```

If a user loaded this page, they would see a loading indicator first and eventually a list of todos.
After they clicked the "Load next page" button, the list would be erased and replaced with a loading indicator again.
At that time, Draqula would start fetching a query with a new `page` variable.

## Caching

Draqula caches data based on the query and the variables you pass to it.
For example, if you loaded `TODOS_QUERY` with `page = 1` before, next time you attempt to request the same query with the same `page = 1` variable, Draqula will immediately return the last data stored for that query.
However, it will still send a request to refetch that data, but in background.
So in cases when there's a cache for a query, `isLoading` will equal to `false`, even when the query is refetching in the background.

It's important to mention, that Draqula implements basic cache mechanism and it invalidates data very aggressively.
If a mutation returns any of the types used in a query, that query's cache will be invalidated and if a query is currently rendered on the page, it will be refetched.

Unlike other GraphQL clients, Draqula also doesn't have normalization of data by `id` or other fields.
Lack of this functionality eliminates a whole range of issues, like incorrect data merges, failed cache reads/writes or requirement to manually specify queries to refetch after a mutation.

Caching can be turned off either globally or individually for each query:

```js
// Turn off caching for all queries
const client = new Draqula('https://my-graphql-server.com/graphql', {
	cache: false
});

// Turn off caching for an individual query
const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(
	TODOS_QUERY,
	{
		page: 1
	},
	{
		cache: false
	}
);
```

## Refetch

Sometimes query results can be out-dated and it's necessary to manually refetch the query due to some side effect.
This is possible via `refetch` function that's returned from `useQuery`:

```jsx
const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error, refetch} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	return (
		<>
			{/* ... */}

			<button onClick={refetch}>Refresh data</button>
		</>
	);
};
```

Note that refetching a query doesn't reset its current `data` and will not switch `isLoading` to `true`, so there won't be a loading indicator.
It's implemented this way, so that user still sees data on the screen, even if fresh data is coming.

Most often, you won't need to call `refetch` manually, since Draqula is very aggressive about cache invalidation.
You can learn more about Draqula's caching mechanism in the ["Caching"](#caching) section above.

## Pagination

If all you need is page-based pagination, where the previous set of data is replaced with a new one, this section is not applicable to your use-case.
For that, you can simply increment the `page` variable and pass it to your query via [variables](/docs/queries#variables).

However, if your app needs to add more data to the list along with existing one (for example, infinite loading), meet the `fetchMore` function.
As the name implies, `fetchMore` fetches more data without deleting the current data.
Let's use page-based pagination for simplicity, but assume that we want to append new todo items at the end of the list.

```jsx
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	query Todos($page: Int!) {
		todos(page: $page) {
			data {
				id
				title
			}
			pagination {
				hasMore
				nextPage
			}
		}
	}
`;

const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error, fetchMore, isFetchingMore} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY, {
		// We don't need a dynamic `page` variable here, because
		// we're always starting with a first page initially, so a fixed initial value will work
		page: 1
	});

	const onFetchMore = () => {
		fetchMore({page: data.todos.pagination.nextPage});
	};

	return (
		<>
			{isLoading && <span>Loading…</span>}
			{error && <span>Error: {error.message}</span>}

			{data && (
				<ul>
					{data.todos.data.map(todo => (
						<li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			)}

			{data.todos.pagination.hasMore && (
				<button disabled={isFetchingMore} onClick={onFetchMore}>
					{isFetchingMore ? 'Loading more todos…' : 'Load more todos'}
				</button>
			)}
		</>
	);
};
```

To prevent you from managing the loading state of `fetchMore` manually (since `isLoading` will remain `false` when `fetchMore` is called), Draqula exposes a `isFetchingMore` variable.
It's the same as `isLoading`, but only reflects the state of the `fetchMore` operation.

### Merging data

Draqula uses the [`_.merge`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#merge) function from Lodash to merge new data into an existing one with custom behavior for arrays.
When Draqula encounters an array in a new response, it will append all the items of that array to the same array in the existing data.
If the array in a new response is `null`, Draqula will ignore it.

This is how merging is implemented in Draqula by default:

```js
import {cloneDeep, mergeWith} from 'lodash';

export default (prevData, nextData) => {
	return cloneDeep(
		mergeWith(prevData, nextData, (prevValue, nextValue) => {
			if (!Array.isArray(prevValue)) {
				// Returning nothing tells Lodash to use default merging strategy
				return;
			}

			// Append new items to the end of the existing array
			return prevValue.concat(nextValue);
		})
	);
};
```

If you want to use a custom merge strategy, for example, to insert items into the start of an array, you can pass a custom `merge` function to `fetchMore`:

```js
const customMerge = (oldData, newData) => {
	// You could copy the default implementation above,
	// but insert items into the start of an array
	// ...
	// return nextValue.concat(prevValue)
	// ...
};

const Todos = () => {
	const {data, isLoading, error, fetchMore} = useQuery(TODOS_QUERY);

	const onFetchMore = () => {
		fetchMore(
			{
				page: data.todos.pagination.nextPage
			},
			{
				merge: customMerge
			}
		);
	};

	// ...
};
```

## Retries

Draqula automatically retries all queries by default, if these conditions are true:

1. There were less than 2 retries (this is configurable)
2. The request didn't respond with 4xx HTTP status code

Retries can be turned off globally or for each query individually:

```js
// Turn off retries for all queries
const client = new Draqula('https://graph.ql', {
	retry: false
});

// Turn off retries only for one query
const {data, isLoading, error} = useQuery(
	TODOS_QUERY,
	{
		page: 1
	},
	{
		retry: false
	}
);
```

It's also possible to configure how many times Draqula should retry the query:

```js
// Retry 5 times (there will be 6 requests since the initial request doesn't count)
const client = new Draqula('https://graph.ql', {
	retry: 5
});
```

If you want more granular control over retries, you can pass an object of options.
These options are the same as the ones [accepted by `retry` module](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry#retryoperationoptions).

## API

### useQuery(query, variables?, options?)

This hook returns [`QueryResult`](/docs/queries#query-result) object.

#### query

Type: `DocumentNode`

Parsed GraphQL query via `gql` function from [`graphql-tag`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) module.
For example:

```js
const TODOS_QUERY = gql`
	{
		todos {
			title
		}
	}
`;
```

#### variables

Type: `object`<br/>
Default: `{}`

Variables to pass along with query.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### options.cache

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `true`

Determines whether to use caching for this query or not.
This option overrides the global `cache` option in the client itself.

##### options.retry

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `true`

Determines whether to retry this query or not.

##### options.timeout

Type: `number`<br/>
Default: `10000`

Timeout to use for this query in milliseconds.
This value overrides the timeout specified in the client itself.

### QueryResult

`useQuery` hook returns an object consisting of the following fields.

#### data

Type: `object | null`

Data from the query response.

#### isLoading

Type: `boolean`

Indicates whether the query is currently loading or not.
`isLoading` is still `false` if query is being refetched via `refetch()` or `fetchMore()`.

#### error

Type: `NetworkError | GraphQLError | null`

Returns an error that occurred during the request, if there was one. Otherwise returns `null`.
Read more in the ["Error handling"](/docs/error-handling) section.

#### fetchMore(variables, fetchMoreOptions)

Type: `Function`

Fetches more data for the current query and merges it with the existing data, instead of replacing it.
Commonly used for pagination.
Variables for this request can be specified via `variables` object as the first argument.
These variables will overwrite the original variables passed to `useQuery`.

Custom merge function can be passed via `merge` field in `fetchMoreOptions` object as the second argument:

```js
fetchMore({page: 2}, {merge: customMergeFn});
```

#### isFetchingMore

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `false`

Indicates whether the `fetchMore` operation is currently in-flight.

#### refetch()

Type: `Function`

Refetches the query with the same variables. Useful for manually refreshing data.
